  <h1>THE BOX MODEL</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      My name is Adams obiefuna. I am seven Years old. I would love to be an engineer who creates cars.
      I love to see cars and i always wish to make a better one.Cars are my favourite toys.And i also like the beauty of the Car. whoever made the first car put his all. Cars give easy transport. Without cars we would have been fainting on the road. Well i thank whoever made or invented the first car. That person is really blessed by God. I also thank those who joined in helping to build more cars for people to use. I also wish that i could join you to help and build more cars. For the benefit of mankind.I conclude by saying and praying that God should bless those who try and risk their lives in making and inventing new cars. God bless you all.
